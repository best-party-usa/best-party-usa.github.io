    <h3>
    1. Making the best politics<br>
    The other parties say always, that they want to make good or better politics, but we are the best party, so we make the best politics!<br><br>
        
    2. Climate change<br>
    The climate change is a huge, maybe even the biggest problem in the near future (if not counting slow WiFi), so we want to stop it, by forbidding it. The climate won't be allowed to change anymore. If it refuses to stop, we will sue it.<br><br>
    
    3. Democracy<br>
    We love democracy, so we will introduce democracy where we can. Even in East Korea.<br><br>
    
    4. Crime<br>
    Crime is bad, so we are going to forbid cime.<br><br>
    
    5. National anthem<br>
    We, the US are very great, proud, beautiful, strong, intelligent and developed nation. Our National authem is also very great and beautiful, but out nation is more, so one authem is not enough. That is the reason why we will introduce "Never Gonna Give You Up" from Rick Astley as a secound national authem.<br><br>
