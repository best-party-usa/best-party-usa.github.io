    <h1>Best Party Program</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
    1. Making the best politics<br>
    The other parties say always, that they want to make good or better politics, but we are the best party, so we make the best politics!<br><br>
        
    2. Climate change
    The climate change is a huge, maybe even the biggest problem in the near future (if not counting slow WiFi), so we want to stop it, by forbidding it. The climate won't be allowed to change anymore. If it refuses to stop, we will sue it.<br><br>
    
    3. Democracy
    We love democracy, so we will introduce democracy where we can. Even in East Korea.<br><br>
    
    4. Crime
    Crime is bad, so we are going to forbid cime.<br><br>
